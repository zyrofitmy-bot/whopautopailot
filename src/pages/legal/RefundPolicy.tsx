              <p>At OrganicSMM, we provide digital social media engagement services. Due to the intangible, immediately-consumable nature of digital services, our refund policy is necessarily limited. By using our services, you confirm that you have read and agreed to this Refund Policy and our Terms of Service before making any purchase.</p>

              <p>Social media engagement (views, followers, likes, comments, etc.) is a <strong className="text-foreground">digital service delivered electronically</strong>. Once delivery has begun:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
                <li>The service cannot be physically "returned"</li>

                <li>The service is considered consumed upon delivery</li>
                <li>This is consistent with standard practice for all digital goods and services globally</li>
